# Project Dragonfly
Project Dragonfly is a handheld game console using the Raspberry Pi Foundation's Compute Module 4.
The goal of this project is simple.
Create an affordable gaming handheld that has decent emulation performance. (If we sell it)
(Dreamcast/n64 and below, and maybe a touch of GameCube)
The specs:
Raspberry Pi CM4

4GB LPDDR4 RAM

7" 600p screen

???? Mah Battery (aiming for 4-5 hours of battery life)


The button layout will be based off of the Nintendo Switch Lite,
and, the best part is: It will be all open source.
Maybe. Possibly. Uhm...
